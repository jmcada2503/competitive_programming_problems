# C Unexpressed

This problem can be solved using brute force, by calculating all the possible combinations of a and b that fullfills the following condition:

```
a^b <= n && a >= 2 && b >= 2
```

After computing all the combinations that works ang inserting them into a set to avoid duplications we can simply get the solution to the problem
